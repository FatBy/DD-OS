2. **Product roadmap** creation
3. **Career planning** and development
4. **Multi-phase project** planning
5. **Competitive positioning** analysis
6. **Resource allocation** decisions
7. **Scenario planning** for uncertainty

## The Strategic Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Vision & Purpose
Define the ultimate goal and why it matters:

1. **Aspirational Vision**: Where do we want to be in 3-5 years?
2. **Core Purpose**: Why does this matter fundamentally?
3. **Guiding Principles**: What values will guide decisions?
4. **Success Metrics**: How will we know we've succeeded?

### Phase 2: Situation Analysis
Understand the current reality:

**Internal Analysis:**
- **Strengths**: What do we do exceptionally well?
- **Weaknesses**: Where do we need improvement?
- **Capabilities**: What skills, resources do we have?
- **Constraints**: What limits our options?

**External Analysis:**
- **Opportunities**: What trends could we leverage?
- **Threats**: What challenges could derail us?
- **Competitive Landscape**: Who competes and how?
- **Market Trends**: What's changing in the environment?

### Phase 3: Strategic Options Generation
Create multiple paths to the vision:

1. **Option A**: Conservative/evolutionary approach
2. **Option B**: Bold/revolutionary approach
3. **Option C**: Hybrid/balanced approach
4. **Option D**: Experimental/pilot approach

Each option includes:
- Core thesis
- Key assumptions
- Resource requirements
- Risk profile
- Time horizon

### Phase 4: Scenario Planning
Prepare for different futures:

| Scenario | Probability | Description | Preparedness |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Base Case** | 50% | Expected trajectory | Primary plan |
| **Upside Case** | 25% | Better than expected | Opportunity capture |
| **Downside Case** | 20% | Challenges emerge | Risk mitigation |
| **Black Swan** | 5% | Unexpected disruption | Resilience plans |

### Phase 5: Roadmapping
Translate strategy to actionable plan:

**Time Horizons:**
- **Now (0-3 months)**: Immediate priorities
- **Next (3-12 months)**: Short-term initiatives
- **Later (1-3 years)**: Medium-term projects
- **Future (3-5 years)**: Long-term vision

**Initiative Structure:**
- **Objective**: What we want to achieve
- **Key Results**: Measurable outcomes
- **Initiatives**: Projects to achieve results
- **Owners**: Who's responsible
- **Timeline**: When it happens
- **Resources**: What's needed

### Phase 6: Execution & Adaptation
Monitor and adjust:

1. **Key Performance Indicators** (KPIs): Track progress
2. **Leading Indicators**: Early warning signals
3. **Review Cadence**: Regular strategy reviews
4. **Adaptation Triggers**: When to change course
5. **Learning Loops**: Capture insights for improvement
